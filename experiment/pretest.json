      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Modulation schemes do not ensure orthogonality.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Orthogonality is not maintained by time separation but frequency spacing.",
        "c": "Correct. Proper subcarrier spacing ensures orthogonality and prevents inter-carrier interference.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Subcarrier spacing must be chosen carefully.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The total bandwidth contains all subcarriers but spacing is smaller.",
        "c": "Correct. This spacing ensures subcarrier orthogonality.",
        "d": "Incorrect. SNR does not determine subcarrier spacing."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Raised cosine filtering is common in single-carrier systems.",
        "b": "Correct. Cyclic prefix absorbs delayed echoes to prevent ISI.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Low-pass filters do not specifically mitigate ISI in OFDM.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. OFDM works well beyond AWGN channels.",

        "c": "Incorrect. Flat fading can be handled by simpler single-carrier systems.",

        "c": "Incorrect. Filtering is done separately.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Demodulation is done at the receiver using FFT."

        "a": "Incorrect. CP is a small fraction of the symbol duration.",
        "b": "Incorrect. CP length is much shorter than the OFDM frame.",
        "c": "Correct. CP must be longer than maximum channel delay spread to avoid ISI.",
        "d": "Incorrect. CP length is measured in time, not subcarrier count."
