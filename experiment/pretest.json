      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. N is the number of subcarriers in OFDM, not the channel length.",
        "b": "Incorrect. N+μ is the total length of the OFDM block with cyclic prefix.",
        "c": "Incorrect. N+μ−1 is not a standard representation of the channel length.",
        "d": "Correct. The FIR length of the channel is μ."

      "question": "Which one of the following is NOT correct in the context of OFDM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "We consider flat fading over the channel corresponding to each sub-carrier",
        "b": "We consider flat fading over the entire channel",
        "c": "This scheme provides efficient bandwidth usage",
        "d": "This scheme can be used in a MIMO system to achieve frequency as well as spatial multiplexing"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Each sub-carrier experiences flat fading due to narrowband division.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is false—OFDM divides the wideband channel into flat fading narrowband sub-carriers.",
        "c": "Correct. OFDM offers efficient use of bandwidth by overlapping subcarriers orthogonally.",
        "d": "Correct. OFDM is compatible with MIMO for both frequency and spatial multiplexing gains."

        "b": "μ",
        "c": "N",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. N+μ is the total number of samples per block, including cyclic prefix.",
        "b": "Incorrect. μ is just the cyclic prefix length and does not represent symbol rate.",
        "c": "Correct. The system transmits N QAM symbols in N+μ samples, giving a rate of N/(N+μ) ≈ N per sample time.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is the correct representation."
