    {
      "question": "Which of the following is correct?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is necessary for this scheme to be effective",
        "b": "Choosing a larger number of sub-carriers will lead to more accurate (less errors) communication",
        "c": "If too many sub-carriers are used, it might lead to inter-carrier interference (ICI)",
        "d": "Cyclic prefix is mandatory even if this scheme is implemented in continuous time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. CSI at the transmitter is helpful but not strictly necessary for OFDM's effectiveness.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A larger number of sub-carriers reduces ICI only up to a point; too many can increase it due to synchronization issues.",
        "c": "Correct. Excessive sub-carriers can cause tight spacing, leading to inter-carrier interference (ICI).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Cyclic prefix is specific to discrete-time implementations for handling circular convolution."

    {
      "question": "What does 'orthogonal' refer to in OFDM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The sub-carriers are all orthogonal to each other, which can mitigate inter-carrier interference (ICI)",
        "b": "The basis signals used to perform QAM encoding are orthogonal",
        "c": "Both of the above",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Orthogonality among sub-carriers ensures they don't interfere with each other in the frequency domain.",
        "b": "Incorrect. QAM encoding does not rely on orthogonal basis signals in this context.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Only sub-carriers are orthogonal, not QAM basis signals.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Sub-carrier orthogonality is fundamental to OFDM."
