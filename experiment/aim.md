In this experiment, we will look at a multi-carrier modulation scheme for frequency selective fading channel.

The objective of this experiment is to understand:
  1) The working principle of OFDM
  2) Modulation and demodulation in this scheme
  3) How it overcomes the effect of intersymbol interference caused by the frequency-selective channel
