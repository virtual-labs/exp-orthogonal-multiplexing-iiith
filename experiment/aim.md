In this experiment, we will look at a multiplexing scheme that utilises the frequency-selective fading channel efficiently to transmit data and achieve higher data rates.

The objective of this experiment is to understand the following:
  1) How the wideband channel is effectively divided into many narrowband channels
  2) Encoding data symbols into multiple carriers
  3) Modulation and demodulation in this scheme
